# Data publication guidelines

## Rationale

One of our missions is to unlock the **biodiversity data** managed by the Research Institute for Nature and Forest ([INBO](http://www.inbo.be)): both existing datasets and data collected through our terrestrial and freshwater observatories for the [LifeWatch research infrastructure](http://lifewatch.inbo.be/blog/pages/about.html). The bulk of these data are occurrence and checklist data, which we publish as open, standardized, well-documented, [GBIF-registered](http://www.gbif.org) [Darwin Core Archives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Core_Archive) on our [GBIF Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT)](http://data.inbo.be/ipt). For each dataset, we also openly track issues and review metadata on GitHub. To maintain a high level of quality and consistency, we started these **data publication guidelines** as a manual for our (and maybe your) data publication efforts.
