# Open biodiversity data publication by the INBO

## Rationale

ðŸ‘‹ We are the [open science lab for biodiversity](https://pureportal.inbo.be/portal/en/organisations/open-science-lab-for-biodiversity(0ab4aa1e-b25f-4dc3-90c1-ddcfbc726fe8).html) and we publish **biodiversity data** as open data. We do this for the [INBO](https://www.inbo.be/en/open-data-policy) and other organizations. The bulk of these data are **occurrences** (e.g. observations) and **checklists** (e.g. species lists), which we document with metadata, format to the international [Darwin Core](https://www.gbif.org/darwin-core) standard, publish on the [INBO IPT](https://ipt.inbo.be) as open data, and register with the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)](https://www.gbif.org) for discovery.

In this repository we keep track of [issues](https://github.com/inbo/data-publication/issues) for published datasets and document our [data publication guidelines](https://github.com/inbo/data-publication/wiki). If you have questions or remarks [leave an issue](https://github.com/inbo/data-publication/issues) or contact us at [@oscibio](https://twitter.com/oscibio) or opendata@inbo.be.

## Datasets

Most of the datasets for which we provide technical supported are hosted on the INBO IPT:

- [Datasets on the IPT](https://ipt.inbo.be/), where datasets are published
- [Datasets on GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/search?hosting_org=1cd669d0-80ea-11de-a9d0-f1765f95f18b), where datasets are discoverable and interoperable
- [Datasets as csv](data/datasets.csv), for a quick overview

## Guidelines

We are trying to [document the guidelines we follow](https://github.com/inbo/data-publication/wiki).
