# Data publication guidelines

## Rationale

One of our missions is to unlock the **biodiversity data** managed by the Research Institute for Nature and Forest ([INBO](http://www.inbo.be)): both existing datasets and data collected through our terrestrial and freshwater observatories for the [LifeWatch research infrastructure](http://lifewatch.inbo.be/blog/pages/about.html). The bulk of these data are occurrence and checklist data, which we publish as open, standardized, well-documented, [GBIF-registered](http://www.gbif.org) [Darwin Core Archives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Core_Archive) on our [GBIF Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT)](http://data.inbo.be/ipt). To maintain a high level of quality and consistency, we started these **data publication guidelines** as a manual for our (and maybe your) data publication efforts.

## Guidelines

### Occurrence data

* [Data guidelines](occurrences/data-guidelines.md)
* [Metadata guidelines](occurrences/metadata-guidelines.md)
* [Data paper guidelines](occurrences/paper-guidelines.md)
 
## Open publication process

For each dataset we create a repository on GitHub, where we can track issues and review the metadata in the open.

* [Repositories for our occurrence datasets](https://github.com/search?q=occurrences+user%3ALifeWatchINBO&type=Repositories)
* [All our datasets](http://data.inbo.be/ipt)

## Fork us

These guidelines are a work a progress, but you are very welcome to fork and use these yourself. If you have suggestions, let us know via [an issue](https://github.com/LifeWatchINBO/data-publication-guidelines/issues) or pull request.
