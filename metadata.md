### Description

A good dataset description:

> VIS - Fishes in inland waters in Flanders, Belgium is a species occurrence dataset published by the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO). The dataset contains over 350.000 fish occurrences sampled between 1992 and 2012 from over 2000 locations in inland rivers, streams, canals, and enclosed waters in Flanders, Belgium. The dataset includes over 75 fish species, as well as a number of bycatch Crustaceans, some of which are invasive. The data are retrieved from the Fish Information System (VIS), a database set up to monitor the status of fishes and their habitats in Flanders and are collected in support of the Water Framework Directive, the Habitat Directive, certain red lists, and biodiversity research. Additional information, such as measurements, absence information and abiotic data are available upon request.
