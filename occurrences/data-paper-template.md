## Abstract

`IPT > Basic metadata > Description`

>The Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO) has been performing standardized fish stock assessments in Flanders, Belgium since 1992. Within this Flemish Fish Monitoring Network, which aims to assess fish populations in public waters at regular time intervals, both inland waters and estuaries were monitored, mainly from March to November (Verreycken et al., 2011). This monitoring was set up in support of the Water Framework Directive, the Habitat Directive, the Eel Regulation, the Red List of fishes, fish stock management, biodiversity research, and to assess the colonization and spreading of non-native fish species. The collected data are consolidated in the Fish Information System or [VIS](http://vis.milieuinfo.be). From VIS, the occurrence data are now published at the [INBO IPT](http://data.inbo.be/ipt) as two datasets: ‘[VIS - Fishes in inland waters in Flanders, Belgium](http://dataset.inbo.be/vis-inland-occurrences)’ and ‘[VIS - Fishes in estuarine waters in Flanders, Belgium](http://dataset.inbo.be/vis-estuarine-occurrences)’. Together these datasets represent a complete overview of the distribution and abundance of fish species pertaining in Flanders from late 1992 to the end of 2012 (figure 1). This data paper discusses both datasets together, as both have a similar methodology and structure. The inland waters dataset contains over 350,000 fish observations, sampled between 1992 and 2012 from over 2,000 locations in inland rivers, streams, canals, and enclosed waters in Flanders. The dataset includes over 64 fish species, as well as a number of non-target species (mainly crustaceans). The estuarine waters dataset contains over 70,000 fish observations, sampled between 1995 and 2012 from almost 50 locations in the estuaries of the rivers Yser and Scheldt (“Zeeschelde”), including two sampling sites in the Netherlands. The dataset includes 116 fish species and a number of non-target crustacean species.

## Rationale

`IPT > Additional metadata > Purpose`

>The Fish Information System or [VIS](http://vis.milieuinfo.be) (figure 2) is a database created by the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO) to monitor the status of fishes and their habitats in Flanders, Belgium and to calculate the biotic integrity (Karr, 1981, Belpaire et al., 2000 & Breine et al., 2004, 2007, 2007) of fish assemblages. It contains data regarding occurrences, individual morphometrics, stocks, pollutants, indices, and non-native fish species. Sampling has been going on since 1992, the database model was designed in 1994 (Verbiest et al, 1994), the first database developed in 1996 (Verbiest et al, 1996), and the consolidated database set up in 2001. VIS is used for supporting NATURA 2000, an ecological network of protected areas in Europe and to calculate the EQR (Ecological Quality Ratio) in the framework of the EU Water Directive (Directive 2000/60/EC). Further, the database provides updated information for Flemish Red Lists of fishes and lampreys (Verreycken et al., 2014) and on the distribution status of non-native and invasive fish species. The data are also crucial in fish stock management and for reporting on the status of the European eel stock as required by the Eel Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) N° 1100/2007).

## Taxonomic coverage

`IPT > Taxonomic coverage > Description`

>The inland waters dataset contains 64 fish species reported from Flemish enclosed waters and watercourses (some of which are non-native or invasive species), as well as a number of non-target species (mainly crustaceans). This dataset also includes a number of typical brackish water fish species which sometimes can be found in inland water sites in proximity to the sea and/or behind the sluice gates. The class of Actinopterygii is best represented (63 species), along with one Petromyzontida (*Lampetra planeri*) and 7 crustaceans from the order Decapoda.

## Geographic coverage

`IPT > Geographic coverage > Description`

>Flanders is one of the three administrative regions in the country of Belgium, located in the centre of Western Europe. The Flemish region is situated in the north of the country and covers an area of 13,522km² (44,29% of Belgium). Belgian has a temperate maritime climate that is influenced by the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean with substantial precipitation in all seasons. The summer is moderate and the winters are mild. The two main geographical regions of Flanders are the coastal plain in the North-West and the Central plain, further inland. With 470 inhabitants/km², Flanders is one of the most densely populated areas of Europe. The three major rivers are the River Yser, the River Scheldt, and the River Meuse. All rivers in Flanders flow into the North Sea, but only the River Yser drains directly into the sea within the jurisdiction of Flanders.

## Dataset

### Dataset description

*Technical description of how the dataset was built. Does not appear in the IPT metadata.*

>The occurrence data from the VIS database are extracted, standardized, and published as two separate Darwin Core Archives: one for inland waters and one for estuarine waters. The main rationale behind this is that both datasets cover different habitats, differ in sampling strategies and methods, and are curated by different scientists. Nevertheless the data model used for inland waters and estuarine waters is identical and can be easily merged: together these datasets represent a complete overview of fish distribution in Flanders from late 1992 to the end of 2012. In 2013 a new set of sampling locations was defined and the data collected since then is currently only available upon request.

>The data are standardized to Darwin Core with a custom SQL view (figure 10) on the original VIS database. The Darwin Core terms (<http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/>) in the dataset at the time of publication are: `occurrenceID`, `type`, `language`, `rights`, `rightsholder`, `datasetID`, `institutionCode`, `collectionCode`, `datasetName`, `ownerInstitutionCode`, `basisOfRecord`, `informationWithheld`, `catalogNumber`, `recordedBy`, `individualCount`, `samplingProtocol`, `samplingEffort`, `eventDate`, `habitat`, `locationID`, `continent`, `waterBody`, `countryCode`, `verbatimLocality`, `verbatimLatitude`, `verbatimLongitude`, `verbatimCoordinateSystem`, `verbatimSRS`, `decimalLatitude`, `decimalLongitude`, `geodeticDatum`, `coordinateUncertaintyInMeters`, `identifiedBy`, `scientificName`, `kingdom`, `taxonRank`, `scientificNameAuthorship`, `vernacularName`, and `nomenclaturalCode`.
