## Abstract

`IPT > Basic metadata > Description`

>The Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO) has been performing standardized fish stock assessments in Flanders, Belgium since 1992. Within this Flemish Fish Monitoring Network, which aims to assess fish populations in public waters at regular time intervals, both inland waters and estuaries were monitored, mainly from March to November (Verreycken et al., 2011). This monitoring was set up in support of the Water Framework Directive, the Habitat Directive, the Eel Regulation, the Red List of fishes, fish stock management, biodiversity research, and to assess the colonization and spreading of non-native fish species. The collected data are consolidated in the Fish Information System or [VIS](http://vis.milieuinfo.be). From VIS, the occurrence data are now published at the [INBO IPT](http://data.inbo.be/ipt) as two datasets: ‘[VIS - Fishes in inland waters in Flanders, Belgium](http://dataset.inbo.be/vis-inland-occurrences)’ and ‘[VIS - Fishes in estuarine waters in Flanders, Belgium](http://dataset.inbo.be/vis-estuarine-occurrences)’. Together these datasets represent a complete overview of the distribution and abundance of fish species pertaining in Flanders from late 1992 to the end of 2012 (figure 1). This data paper discusses both datasets together, as both have a similar methodology and structure. The inland waters dataset contains over 350,000 fish observations, sampled between 1992 and 2012 from over 2,000 locations in inland rivers, streams, canals, and enclosed waters in Flanders. The dataset includes over 64 fish species, as well as a number of non-target species (mainly crustaceans). The estuarine waters dataset contains over 70,000 fish observations, sampled between 1995 and 2012 from almost 50 locations in the estuaries of the rivers Yser and Scheldt (“Zeeschelde”), including two sampling sites in the Netherlands. The dataset includes 116 fish species and a number of non-target crustacean species. To foster broad and collaborative use, the data are dedicated to the public domain under a [Creative Commons Zero waiver](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) and reference the [INBO norms for data use](https://github.com/LifeWatchINBO/norms-for-data-use).

## Rationale

`IPT > Additional metadata > Purpose`

>The Fish Information System or [VIS](http://vis.milieuinfo.be) (figure 2) is a database created by the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO) to monitor the status of fishes and their habitats in Flanders, Belgium and to calculate the biotic integrity (Karr, 1981, Belpaire et al., 2000 & Breine et al., 2004, 2007, 2007) of fish assemblages. It contains data regarding occurrences, individual morphometrics, stocks, pollutants, indices, and non-native fish species. Sampling has been going on since 1992, the database model was designed in 1994 (Verbiest et al, 1994), the first database developed in 1996 (Verbiest et al, 1996), and the consolidated database set up in 2001. VIS is used for supporting NATURA 2000, an ecological network of protected areas in Europe and to calculate the EQR (Ecological Quality Ratio) in the framework of the EU Water Directive (Directive 2000/60/EC). Further, the database provides updated information for Flemish Red Lists of fishes and lampreys (Verreycken et al., 2014) and on the distribution status of non-native and invasive fish species. The data are also crucial in fish stock management and for reporting on the status of the European eel stock as required by the Eel Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) N° 1100/2007).

## Collection

`IPT  >  Collection Data > Collection`

The collection metadata for the resource includes the *Collection Name* ; *Collection Identifier*; *Parent Collection Identifier* and the *Specimen preservation method*

> The invertebrate collection 'RBINS:Invertebrates`is incredibly diverse, containing sponges, corals, starfish, crustaceans, jellyfish, rotifers, leeches, and more. There are “dry” collections and “wet” collections; all are housed in eight storerooms with temperature and humidity conditions that are carefully managed for long-term storage. The wet collections were mostly built up in the 1930s and are continually being added to today. They consist of an estimated half a million jars and tubes of specimens in alcohol. The majority of the dry collections are made up of shells – approximately ten million specimens. One of the most important shell collections is that of 19th century amateur collector Philippe Dautzenberg, who also left behind a rich archive. The published dataset contains the digitized information on this collection.
The invertebrate collections are invaluable to taxonomy and systematic biology. We have tens of thousands of type specimens, which are the benchmarks used when describing a species. The other 15 million “voucher” specimens are also important for understanding and describing morphological variation – and increasingly also genetic variation – within species. Biologists can therefore study the evolutionary relationships between organisms, including relationships with extinct species.

## Taxonomic coverage

`IPT > Taxonomic coverage > Description`

>The inland waters dataset contains 64 fish species reported from Flemish enclosed waters and watercourses (some of which are non-native or invasive species), as well as a number of non-target species (mainly crustaceans). This dataset also includes a number of typical brackish water fish species which sometimes can be found in inland water sites in proximity to the sea and/or behind the sluice gates. The class of Actinopterygii is best represented (63 species), along with one Petromyzontida (*Lampetra planeri*) and 7 crustaceans from the order Decapoda.

## Geographic coverage

`IPT > Geographic coverage > Description`

>Flanders is one of the three administrative regions in the country of Belgium, located in the centre of Western Europe. The Flemish region is situated in the north of the country and covers an area of 13,522km² (44,29% of Belgium). Belgian has a temperate maritime climate that is influenced by the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean with substantial precipitation in all seasons. The summer is moderate and the winters are mild. The two main geographical regions of Flanders are the coastal plain in the North-West and the Central plain, further inland. With 470 inhabitants/km², Flanders is one of the most densely populated areas of Europe. The three major rivers are the River Yser, the River Scheldt, and the River Meuse. All rivers in Flanders flow into the North Sea, but only the River Yser drains directly into the sea within the jurisdiction of Flanders.

###Geographical method `optional`

Geographical method is not provided in the IPT metadata as such.

>The Universal Transverse Mercator Projection (UTM), an adaptation of the standard Mercator projection, uses a two dimensional Cartesian co-ordinate system to identify locations on the surface of the Earth (Wikipedia).

>The UTM 5 Km (Universal Transverse Mercator Projection) raster projection divides Belgium in approximately 1200 25 km² squares (Figure 3). A representative number of UTM squares has been sampled (1125 UTM 5×5 km squares of which 659 squares with more than 10 records: see Figures 3 and 4) to complete the dataset. All the records in FORMIDABEL are georeferenced through the centroid coordinates of the corresponding UTM 5 km square. Therefore, the uncertainty on these coordinates is 3.500 meters, the distance between the centre and the corner of the UTM square.

### Bounding coordinates

`IPT > Geographic coverage > Coordinates`

-90° to 90° latitude, -180° to 180 longitude

>Flanders: 50.68 to 51.51 latitude, 2.54 to 5.92 longitude.

## Dataset

### Dataset description

*Technical description of how the dataset was built. Does not appear in the IPT metadata.*

>The occurrence data from the VIS database are extracted, standardized, and published as two separate Darwin Core Archives: one for inland waters and one for estuarine waters. The main rationale behind this is that both datasets cover different habitats, differ in sampling strategies and methods, and are curated by different scientists. Nevertheless the data model used for inland waters and estuarine waters is identical and can be easily merged: together these datasets represent a complete overview of fish distribution in Flanders from late 1992 to the end of 2012. In 2013 a new set of sampling locations was defined and the data collected since then is currently only available upon request.

>The data are standardized to Darwin Core with a custom SQL view (figure 10) on the original VIS database. The Darwin Core terms (<http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/>) in the dataset at the time of publication are: `occurrenceID`, `type`, `language`, `rights`, `rightsholder`, `datasetID`, `institutionCode`, `collectionCode`, `datasetName`, `ownerInstitutionCode`, `basisOfRecord`, `informationWithheld`, `catalogNumber`, `recordedBy`, `individualCount`, `samplingProtocol`, `samplingEffort`, `eventDate`, `habitat`, `locationID`, `continent`, `waterBody`, `countryCode`, `verbatimLocality`, `verbatimLatitude`, `verbatimLongitude`, `verbatimCoordinateSystem`, `verbatimSRS`, `decimalLatitude`, `decimalLongitude`, `geodeticDatum`, `coordinateUncertaintyInMeters`, `identifiedBy`, `scientificName`, `kingdom`, `taxonRank`, `scientificNameAuthorship`, `vernacularName`, and `nomenclaturalCode`.

## Discussion `optional`

Discussion of the dataset. Does not appear in the IPT metadata. A discussion is optional in a data paper. 

>Using citizen science data generated by an on line application is often a challenge for professional researchers (Crall et al., 2011). Scientists may be hindered by the perception that the data are of low quality. However, many studies indicate that the quality of data generated by volunteers differ little from data generated from professionals.  Especially, when given proper training and materials, volunteers can collect data comparable to data collected by professional scientists (Au et al., 2000; Canfield et al. 2002; Fore et al., 2001; Delaney et al., 2008). Studies indicate that citizens scientists who feel that they are making contributions to the scientific study return higher quality data (Nerbonne & Nelson, 2008). The global community around divers is large and diverse. But if only a small percentage of the active divers would log their dives in a GBIF connected online logbook, a great amount of data would become available for scientific use. By creating a personal standardized divelog for every diver, where exhaustive species information and dive locality information is automatically provided, we hope with this initiative to motivate more and more divers to publish their dives and observations on the internet.
Sampling bias will occur, it is impossible to memorize every observed organism during a dive and divers obviously only remember the 'most impressive' organisms encountered. Several sorts of bias may be present in the data, such as under- and over detection of species (a huge share of Elasmobranchii are recorded in the dataset and only a small amount of invertebrates is reported) or the non-random distribution of effort (Crall et al., 2011).     
Nevertheless, a 100% community generated dataset can provide a useful basis for science. This was showcased by the lionfish case. 

## History of the dataset `optional`

History of the dataset does not appear in the IPT metadata. The history of the dataset section is optional in a data paper.

>Dataset history
At the beginning of 2001 all available records of ants in Flanders (northern part of Belgium) were brought together for the first time and several inventories were started. More than 20.000 records (for the most part gathered after 1990) were assembled in the FORMIDABEL (FORMIcidaeDAtaBELgium) database resulting in the ‘Verspreidingsatlas en voorlopige Rode lijst van de mieren van Vlaanderen; Dekoninck et al. 2003. [Distribution atlas and preliminary Red list of ant species in Flanders, Belgium]. This report contains all available distribution data for Flanders. In the southern part of Belgium (Wallonia) intensive inventorying started in 2005. Until then knowledge on the distribution of ants in Wallonia was limited. Only a few areas (Haute Fagnes, Famenne and the Viroin valley) had already been inventoried. Thanks to the good cooperation between the Polyergus and the FourmisWalBru working groups; many Belgian ant records were brought together in the FORMIDABEL database. Since then, FORMIDABEL is updated with data originating from FourmisWalBru twice a year. The FORMIDABEL dataset was then used for the creation of the “Belgian Ant Atlas”, (Dekoninck et al. 2012). In 2010 a cooperation agreement between the authors of the atlas and the Belgian Biodiversity Platform (www.biodiversity.be) was made. Together with the publication of the book, the data was published in Darwin Core Archives to GBIF (url: http://data.gbif.org/datasets/resource/14697/) and a dedicated data portal was created: www.formicidae-atlas.be.

>The original FORMIDABEL database was created in Microsoft Access. Later, this database was completely imported in a relational SQL database. During this process additional data cleaning was performed; see section Quality control description. The dataflow is illustrated in Figure 6. 



## Methodology

### Study extent description

`IPT > Sampling methods > Study extent`

>Over 2,000 locations in estuaries, inland rivers, streams, canals, and enclosed waters in Flanders, Belgium have been sampled since 1992. In 2001, these locations were consolidated in a monitoring network ("VISmeetnet") of 900 sampling points. Four locations in the Yser estuary and 43 locations in the Scheldt were sampled since 1995. While the Yser estuary only covers a small geographical area, the Scheldt estuary is with 33,000 hectares one of the largest estuaries in Europe. It is also one of the few remaining European estuaries that includes the entire gradient from fresh to saltwater tidal areas (Van den Bergh et al., 2009). The 43 sampling locations in the Scheldt estuary are mainly located in the River Scheldt, but also in the Rivers Durme, Rupel, Dijle, Zenne and Nete.

>The geographic coordinates in both datasets are those of the defined sampling locations (`dwc:locationID`). However, as these coordinates are not always exact the actual coordinates of the catch, which may be located further up- or downriver, the coordinate uncertainty (`dwc:coordinateUncertaintyInMeters`) has been set to 250 meter.

### Sampling description

`IPT > Sampling methods > Sampling description`

>In inland waters, standardized sampling methods were used as described in Belpaire et al., 2000 and Van Thuyne, 2010 and are specified in the dataset as `dwc:samplingProtocol`. Per water body, the same method was used for each sampling event. The default method is electric fishing, but additional techniques such as gill nets, fykes, and seine netting (variable sizes) were used as well. Electric fishing was carried out using a 5kW generator with an adjustable output voltage of 300-500V and a pulse frequency of 480Hz. The number of electric fishing devices and hand-held anodes used depends on the river width (Belpaire et al., 2000). In riverine environments, electric fishing was carried out on both riverbanks in upstream direction. All fishes were identified to species level, counted, and their length and weight was measured.

>The default method used in estuarine waters is paired fyke netting, but additional techniques such as anchor netting, seine netting, pound netting, electric fishing, and eel fyke netting were used as well (Breine et al., 2011). All fishes were identified to species level, counted their length and weight was measured.


### Quality control description

`IPT > Sampling methods > Quality control`

>Strict field protocols where used. The Manual for Application of the European Fish Index (EFI) (Fame consortium, 2004) served as a guideline for electrofishing and was used in support of the EU water framework directive.

>Users of the data can comment on the inland waters and estuarine waters dataset at <https://github.com/LifeWatchINBO/vis-inland-occurrences> and <https://github.com/LifeWatchINBO/vis-estuarine-occurrences> respectively.
