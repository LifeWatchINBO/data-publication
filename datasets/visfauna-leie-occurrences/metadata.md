## Abstract

*Visfauna - Juvenile and adult fishes in riparian habitats along the river Leie in Flanders, Belgium* is a species occurrence dataset published by the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO). The dataset contains over 470 fish occurrences sampled in 2009 in riparian habitats along the river Leie. The dataset includes 8 fish species. The data are collected to investigate the feasibility of a comprehensive study on the impact of the present ecological engineered river banks ("NTMB-oevers") on fish populations in the Leie. The dataset also includes the length and weight of the caught fishes. Issues with the dataset can be reported at <https://github.com/LifeWatchINBO/data-publication/tree/master/datasets/visfauna-leie-occurrences>

## Methodology

### Study extent description

Nine sites of riparian habitats along the river Leie in Flanders, Belgium, between the dam of Sint-Baafs-Vijve (Zulte) and Deinze, covering different bank types.

### Sampling description

The fishes were sampled using fykes and electrofishing, on August 18 and 19, 2009. The number of individuals was recorded, as well as fork length (tip of snout to fork of tail in millimeter) and weight (gram).

### Quality control description

All records are validated.

### Method step description

Fykes and electrofishing were used to sample the riparian habitats.
