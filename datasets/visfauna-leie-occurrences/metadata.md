## Abstract

The dataset contains occurrences of juvenile and adult fish in the river Leie in riparian habitats and was created to investigate the feasibility of a comprehensive study on the impact of the present NTMB-banks on fish populations in the Leie. The data was collected with regard to timing, sampling techniques and constraints. Specifically, the different bank types sampled within the study area, the Leie between Deinze and the dam of Saint Bavo-Vijve (Zulte). Several examples of each type of shoreline were sampled with two sampling techniques: fyke fishing and electrical fishing.

## Rationale

> For many years, navigable lowland rivers have been embanked artificially or suffered from substantial shipping wave action, leading to habitat degradation. Recently, riparian habitats were restored by creating foreshores and spawning grounds in the river Yser, a lowland river in Flanders, Belgium. The aim of the research was to evaluate the role of these restored habitats for spawning and nursery of juvenile fish. To cover a wide range of anthropogenic disruption, four riparian mesohabitat types were selected and compared, ranging from semi‐natural, over artificial spawning grounds and foreshores, to artificial embankments. Juvenile fish were subjected to sampling by using electrofishing between June and September 2009 at different microhabitats located in five sites of each riparian mesohabitat type. The study (Mouton et al. 2011) found that juvenile fish strongly preferred natural riparian habitats, whereas artificial embankments showed the lowest species richness, abundance and functional organization of juvenile fish species. Restored riparian habitats appeared to be an appropriate alternative for artificial embankments in navigable lowland rivers, but still score significantly less than natural habitats. Juvenile fish avoided bare microhabitats, but did not prefer any other microhabitat type (reed, woody or grassy vegetation), emphasizing the importance of microhabitat diversity.
