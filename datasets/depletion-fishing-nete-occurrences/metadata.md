## Abstract

The dataset contains the total catch number and total weight of th
e catch of fish species which has been electrofished in the rivers "Grote Nete" and "Kleine Nete" in Belgium. The scope of the project was to make an inventory of fish species abundance and density in both rivers. The data were used to make a red list of fish species in Flanders.

## Geographic coverage

The rivers Grote Nete and Kleine Nete in Flanders, Belgium. The Grote Nete (Big Nete) originates near Hechtel in the province of Limburg, while the Kleine Nete (Small Nete) originates more northwest near Retie in the province of Antwerp. Both rivers flow west and join in Lier (Antwerp), where they continue as the Nete.

### Bounding box

## Temporal coverage

1989-05-23 - 1996-11-27

## Methodology

### Study extent description

This dataset is a subset of an historical dataset used to make an atlas of fish in Flanders.

### Sampling description

Wading hand held DC electric fishing. Dipnets and electrodes were used.

### Quality control description

Checked

### Method step description

The recorder wades through the river holding one of the two electrodes. The recorder follows a traject against the current. All catched fish was measured and weighted.
