## Abstract

*Loopkevers Grensmaas - Ground beetles near the river Meuse in Flanders, Belgium* is a species occurrence dataset published by the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO). The dataset contains over 5,800 beetle occurrences sampled between 1998 and 1999 from 28 locations on the left bank (Belgium) of the river Meuse on the border between Belgium and the Netherlands. The dataset includes over 100 ground beetles species (Carabidae) and some non-target species. The data were used to assess the dynamics of the Grensmaas area and to help river management. Issues with the dataset can be reported at <https://github.com/LifeWatchINBO/data-publication/tree/master/datasets/kevers-grensmaas-occurrences>

## Rationale

Variation in time and space is a key characteristic of the river Meuse. Ground beetles are a good indicator to assess these dynamics. The goal of this project was to better understand the dynamics of the Grensmaas and help river management, habitat restoration and policy.

## Taxonomic coverage

Almost all 107 species in this dataset are ground beetles (Carabidae), identified to species. The dataset also includes some non-target species: *Chorthippus*, *Oedipoda*, and *Tetrix* (Orthoptera) and *Lamyctes* (Chilopoda). The top 3 recorded species are *Bembidion tetracolum* (9%), *Bembidion femoratum* (8%), and *Agonum muelleri* (7%).

## Methodology

### Study extent description

28 locations on the left bank (Belgium) of the river Meuse on the border between Belgium and the Netherlands.

### Sampling description

The beetles were sampled at 80 plots, with 3 pitfall traps per plot. Sampling occurrened in 1998 and 1999, from May to October.

### Quality control description

All sampled carabid species were determined by experts. All records are validated.

### Method step description

Pitfalls were placed on 80 plots and sampled from May to October.
