# Broedvogel - Atlas of breeding birds in Flanders, Belgium (2000-2002)

## Abstract

The first atlas of breeding birds in Flanders was published in 1988 and was based on fieldwork conducted between 1973-1977 (Devillers et al. 1988). For almost three decades, this work provided the only information available on the distribution and abundance of all breeding bird species in Flanders. Although several species-specific projects were subsequently undertaken, it was not until 1994 that a monitoring programme for rare, colonial and exotic bird species was initiated. This was co-ordinated by the INBO, a research institute of the Flemish Government. Although this project provided very useful information that could be used for defining special protection areas (SPAs), it was clear that the rest of the breeding avifauna, including common species, was experiencing major changes. As a direct response, during 1998, a new comprehensive breeding atlas project was launched by the INBO and initial contracts were drawn-up to kick-start the process.

During the 2000-2002 atlas period, a total of 183 species were recorded as breeding birds in Flanders, including 13 exotic species but excluding domesticated forms of Greylag Goose, Mallard and Stock Dove and two subspecies (Yellow Wagtail ssp. flavissima and White Wagtail ssp. yarrellii).
