## Abstract

The Saltabel dataset deals with grasshopper and cricket occurrences in Belgium. The data are largely gathered by volunteer naturalists, who also reviewed and digitized data from existing museum and university collections in Belgium. Input in a database, feedback to observers, validation and database maintenance were cared for by a professional employee at the Institute for Nature Conservation (IN), now INBO (The Institute for Forest and Nature research). The Saltabel (Salta < Saltatoria; bel > Belgium) working group was established in 1989. The purpose of the Saltabel Database was mainly to collect information about the distribution, faunistics and ecology of grasshoppers and crickets in Belgium, The Netherlands and Luxembourg.  The working group produced a newsletter which appeared irregularly in the period 1989-2002 with the intention to inform observers about latest findings, interesting observations, ecological research etc., provide feedback to naturalists and to raise awareness about the conservation value of Orthoptera in general. During this period, the working group was most active and organized annual weekends, in turn organized in Belgium, the Netherlands and sometimes also northern France . These weekends were intended to perform inventories for badly prospected regions and to stimulate knowledge exchange between collaborators. In 1997, a standard work on the grasshoppers and crickets of The Netherlands was published using data from this project (Kleukers et al. 1997). In 2000, a provisional atlas and red lists of grasshoppers and crickets in Flanders , Brussels and Wallonia was published (Decleer et al. 2000), providing the first major output of this faunistic project for Belgium. As a consequence, the interest for grasshoppers and crickets in conservation increased, as these insects became important indicators of natural quality and successful nature management. After this milestone, the working group lost some incentive, the network of volunteers was no longer professionally supported and Saltabel became less active. In 2006, a dedicated survey was organised in Brussels Capital Region through the SaltaBru project, greatly increasing the number of records for this region. More recently, Saltabel became a study group of the Flemish NGO Natuurpunt and the working group revived with numerous activities and a growing number of recorders involved (<http://www.saltabel.org>). Since 2011, the online encoding platform <http://www.waarnemingen.be> is promoted and used for online reporting of records. Since 2012, the focus of the working group was put on enhancing the knowledge of threatened species in Flanders, with dedicated surveys prospecting historically known locations of e.g. Stenobothrus stigmaticus, Stenobothrus lineatus and Ephippiger ephippiger. The database described here, however, does not contain these recent records.

## Data published through

<http://doi.org/10.15468/1rcpsq>

## Rationale

The dataset was developed to create the red lists of Orthoptera in Flanders, Wallonia, and the Brussels Capital Region. Further the data was used to create an atlas of Orthoptera in Belgium.

## Taxonomic coverage

The datasets contains all the Orthopterian species known to Belgium. The original taxonomical checklist used for this dataset is the list of (Decleer et Al, 2000), based on the taxonomic information provided by Fauna Europaea (<http://www.faunaeur.org/>). 34 Orthopterian genera are included in the dataset (fig 1). The most frequently found genera are Chortippus, Tetrix, Tettigonia and Pholidoptera. They represent about 60 % off all the occurrences in Belgium.

The least frequent sightings originate from some exotic (Tachycines; Anacridium), rare (Psophus), extinct (Calliptamus) and almost extinct species like Gampsocleis.

## Geographic coverage

Belgium is a small country in the heart of Western Europe. To the west, its 70 km coastline fronts the North Sea; to the north lies the Netherlands; to the east, Germany, and to the south, France and Luxembourg. Biogeographically, Belgium lies within the Palearctic and consists mainly of tempered broad leaf and mixed forests.

Politically and geographically, the country is divided into three parts: Flanders, Wallonia and the Brussels Capital Region. In Flanders (13,522 km² and population about 6 million people), to the north, soils are mainly sandy to loamy. The Brussels Capital Region is a small region (162 km²) entirely situated in the sandy loam area. In Wallonia (17,006 km² and about 3,5 million people), to the south, soils and habitats are more diverse, ranging from forests to rocky and calcareous grasslands on loam and chalky soils. Eastern Wallonia, near the German border, includes the Hautes Fagnes, a large area of bogs and peat.

Belgium has a temperate maritime climate influenced by the North Sea and Atlantic Ocean, with cool summers and moderate winters. Since the country is small there is little variation in climate from region to region, although the marine influences are less inland. Rainfall is distributed throughout the year with a dryer period from April to September. Especially in fall and winter strong Atlantic low-pressure systems can bring strong winds and uncomfortable weather. Sometimes easterly winds can cause a more continantal type of weather, warm and dry in the summer, but cold and clear in the winter with temperatures sometimes far below zero (www.weatheronline.co.uk).

The North of Belgium is a flat and has often breezy conditions, although more in the winter than in the summer, and more among the coastal areas than inland. In the eastern and  southern regions hills cause a cooler and wetter climate with more rainfall and sometimes heavy snowfall in the winter.

Koeppen-Geiger classification: The climate of Belgium can be classified as Cfb Climate; a warm temperate humid climate with the warmest month lower than 22°C over average and four or more months above 10°C over average. (<http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/>)

## Methodology

The data are largely gathered by volunteer naturalists, who also reviewed and digitized data from existing museum and university collections in Belgium. Input in a database, feedback to observers, validation and database maintenance were cared for by a professional employee at the Institute for Nature Conservation (IN), now INBO (The Institute for Forest and Nature research).

### Study extent description

The data are gathered in the context of an atlas on Orthoptera in Belgium and the creation of regional red lists for grasshoppers and crickets in Flanders, Wallonia, and the Brussels Capital Region.

### Sampling description

The data mostly comprise loose human observations by volunteer naturalists. Also a significant amount of records originate from net sampling and the intelligent use of bat detectors, and digitized data from existing museum and university collections in Belgium (approx. 9589 records, i.e. 20%). Unfortunately, a clear link between record and specimen got lost during the creation of the Saltabel database. However, the institution holding the specimen can be tracked in the specimen. Figure 2 illustrates the difference in observational data and data originating from preserved specimens.

### Quality control description

Data are first validated by experts; only the validated records are published.

### Method step description

Observations pertaining to common species which were previously validated to occur in the neighbouring grid cells of 5 x 5 km squares are automatically validated. Observations of species that are considered rare, or common species that have not been recorded in the neighbouring grid cells are subjected to a manual control by experts.
