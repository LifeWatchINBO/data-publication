**Abstract**

The NICHE-Vlaanderen project had the goal to develop an hydro-ecological prediction model, used in ecological impact assessment studies. 
The data in this dataset is part of the vegetation-plot data used to feed the model and contains groundwater depending terrestrial vegetation relevées in relation to groundwater levels. Vegetation plot relevés were performed near selected piezometers (WATINA database, groundwater network Flanders) between May and August in 2002, 2004 and 2005. 
Initially the vegetation surveys were recorded in Turboveg (Hennekens, 1998) and later on moved to INBOVEG, the INBO vegetation plot database.
The dataset contains 569 vegetation relevées, recorded during the fieldwork of the NICHE-Vlaanderen project. Relevées contain species coverage data, coverage data for layers, vegetation height and the date of recording. All the vegetation relevées were classified as vegetation types.

#**General description**

**Purpose**: 

The goal of "NICHE-Vlaanderen" is to adapt the Dutch hydro-ecological prediction model “NICHE (Nature Impact Assessment of Changes in Hydro‐Ecological Systems)" for Flanders. The "NICHE-Vlaanderen" tool will be used to predict the effects on vegetation due to changes in hydrological conditions. This dataset only contains the vegetation plot data collected during the time of the project (2002 – 2006). The complete NICHE-Vlaanderen set also contains data of literature.

**Project details**

**Project title**:  NICHE – VlaanderenPersonnel: Els De Bie
**Funding**: Funded by the Flemish government, SVW, and Pidpa

**Study area descriptions/descriptor**: 
Based on the WATINA database (Water in Nature Reserves) a selection of locations in Flemisch nature reserves was made for NICHE-Vlaanderen. The selection criteria were: hydrologic data must be available for minimum 1 year (more is better) and no significant disturbance occurred between the hydrological data collection and the vegetation survey. ‘Disturbances' are indications for a possible unbalance between vegetation occurrence and the abiotic environment, due to for example drainage, ground works, water supply, etc. 

**Design description**: The goal of "Niche Vlaanderen" is to adapt the Dutch "hydro-ecological model NICHE (Nature Impact Assessment of Changes in Hydro‐Ecological Systems)" for Flanders. The "Niche Vlaanderen" tool will be used to evaluate the effects of interventions in water management such as river restoration, ground water collection,  etc.

**Taxonomic coverage**

General taxonomic coverage description: For every vegetation plot the tracheophytes and bryophytes were determined.
Taxonomic ranks
Kingdom: Plantae
Phylum: Tracheophyta, Bryophyta


**Spatial coverage**

**General spatial coverage**: Flanders, Watina (Water in Nature Reserves) Network
Flanders, Belgium

Flanders has a temperate maritime climate influenced by the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, with relatively moderate summers and mild winters. Flanders is the northern part of Belgium. The two main geographical regions of Flanders are the Yser basin, in the North-West and the central plain. 

All the vegetation survey data originates from plots close to the measuring points of the WATINA hydrologic monitoring network in Flanders.
Coordinates: 50°40'48''N and 51°30'36''N Latitude; 2°32'24''E and 5°55'12''E Longitude 

**Temporal coverage**: March 1, 2002 - December 30, 2005

**Methods**

*Method step description*: 
Vegetation relevé data is recorded in the InboVeg database. This data was mapped to Darwin Core by creating a specific view. We mapped the data to Darwin core event, Darwin Core occurrence extension and Darwin Core Measurements or Facts for the specific Relevé data. 
In our sandbox ipt the releve data is also mapped to Darwin Core GBIF releve. This data is only available on http://oefendata.inbo.be/ipt/resource?r=inboveg_niche_vlaanderen

**Study extent description**: INBOVEG - Niche Vlaanderen

Vegetation plot surveys were performed between May and August of 2002, 2004 and 2005 near selected piezometers (INBO-WATINA project). Coordinates were taken of the WATINA database. 

**Sampling description**: Sampling Methods

Vegetation surveys: Vegetation, neighbouring the selected WATINA piezometer is described using a nearby vegetation plot (forests: 10x10m², open vegetations:  3x3 m²). The piezometer usually is one of the corners of the plot if not too much disturbed.
An orientated location sketch was created for every plot, to make repeatability possible. For every plot, all occurring species were determined and for every vertical layer (Trees, Shrubs, Herbs and Mosses) the coverage (horizontal projection) was estimated in percentages. For every species the coverage was estimated using the scale of Londo. This scale is very detailled, especially for species with a low coverage (below 5%).
