##Sampling Methods
###Vegetation surveys

Vegetation, neighbouring each WATINA Piezometer is described using a nearby vegetation plot. In forests the plot measures 10X10m² in open vegetations this plot measures 3X3 m². The Piezometer usually is one of the corners of the plot.

A orientated location sketch was created for every survey, to make repeatability possible. 

For every plot, all occurring species were determined and for every vertical layer (Trees, Shrubs, Herbs and Mosses) the coverage was measured (Londo scale).
