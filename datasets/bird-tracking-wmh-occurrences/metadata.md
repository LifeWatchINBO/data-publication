## Abstract

*Bird tracking - GPS tracking of Western Marsh Harriers breeding near the Belgium-Netherlands border* is a species occurrence dataset published by the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO). The dataset contains over 290.000 occurrences (GPS fixes) recorded between 2013 and 2017 by GPS trackers mounted on 6 Western Marsh Harriers breeding near the Belgium-Netherlands border. The trackers are developed by the University of Amsterdam Bird Tracking System (UvA-BiTS, http://www.uva-bits.nl) and allow to study the harriers' habitat use and migration behaviour in great detail. Our bird tracking network is operational since 2013 and is maintained and used by the INBO, the Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ), UvA-BiTS, Ghent University (UGent), and the University of Antwerp (UA). See the dataset metadata for contact information, scope, and methodology. Issues with the dataset can be reported at https://github.com/inbo/data-publication/tree/master/datasets/bird-tracking-wmh-occurrences

The following information is not included in the dataset and available upon request: outliers, speed, temperature, barometric pressure, GPS metadata (fix time, number of satellites used, vertical accuracy), and bird weight measured during tagging.

To allow anyone to use this dataset, we have released the data to the public domain under a Creative Commons Zero waiver (http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). We would appreciate however, if you read and follow these norms for data use (http://www.inbo.be/en/norms-for-data-use) and provide a link to the original dataset (https://doi.org/10.15468/rbguhj) whenever possible. If you use these data for a scientific paper, please cite the dataset following the applicable citation norms and/or consider us for co-authorship. We are always interested to know how you have used or visualized the data, or to provide more information, so please contact us via the contact information provided in the metadata, opendata@inbo.be or https://twitter.com/LifeWatchINBO.

The bird tracking network used to collect these data is set up and maintained by the INBO and VLIZ as part of the Flemish contribution to LifeWatch.

## Rationale

...

## Taxonomic coverage

The dataset contains tracking data from 6 Western Marsh Harriers (*Circus aeruginosus*) breeding near the Belgium-Netherlands border.

### Taxonomic ranks

**Kingdom**: *Animalia* (animals)

**Phylum**: *Chordata*

**Class**: *Aves* (birds)

**Order**: *Falconiformes*

**Family**: *Accipitridae*

**Genus**: *Circus* (harriers)

**Species**: *Circus aeruginosus* (Western Marsh Harrier)

## Geographic coverage

The tracked birds were tagged in their breeding range near the Belgium-Netherlands border. It is a polder area dominated by creeks, located in the provinces of East-Flanders (Belgium) and Zeeland (the Netherlands) bordered by the Western Scheldt in the north and the Ghent-Terneuzen Canal in the east. During breeding season, the foraging range of the harriers is generally restricted to less than 10 km from the nest. Starting in September the birds migrate south, hibernating in Sub-Saharan areas of West Africa. Spring arrivals start in March.
