## Abstract

*Invasive species - Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis) in Flanders, Belgium* is a species occurrence dataset published by the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO). The dataset contains over 6,000 occurrences (Chinese mitten crab exclusively) sampled between 2000 and now. The data are compiled from different monitoring initiatives at the INBO. The Chinese mitten crab is listed as a species of EU concern sensu the EU regulation 1143/2014 on the prevention and management of the introduction of invasive alien species (IAS). This requires member states to report on the status of such species. Issues with the dataset can be reported at https://github.com/LifeWatchINBO/data-publication/tree/master/datasets/invasive-chinese-mitten-crab-occurrences

## Rationale

Native to the Pacific coasts of China and Korea, Chinese mitten crabs arrived in European waters in the early 1900s and are believed to have been introduced via ship's ballast water and, possibly, intentionally released to establish fisheries (Marquard 1926, Peters et al. 1933, Gollasch 2006). Since its arrival in Germany, the species has rapidly invaded coastal and inland waters throughout Europe. It was first recorded in Belgium in 1933 in the Zeeschelde near Antwerp (Wouters 2002, Boets 2013). Based on recent observations, it is now common in Flanders (Messiaen 2010), in flowing as well as still waters, where it is benefitting from improved water quality (Kerckhof et al. 2007, Stevens 2010). In the last few years, the species has increased in distribution area and numbers, and is now colonizing inland waters. The Scheldt estuary is the most important invasion route, where its numbers seem to have stabilized in recent years (unpublished data, INBO). The seasonal upstream migration of mitten crabs has become a well known phenomenon in Flanders (e.g. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSBqwufl3pA), but its impact in the region is not well known.

The Chinese mitten crab is listed as a species of EU concern sensu the EU regulation 1143/2014 on the prevention and management of the introduction of invasive alien species (IAS). This regulation requires member states to set up surveillance and early warning, as well as rapidly eradicate new introductions of a selection of IAS. Additionally, it requires member states to set up management programmes for widely established species and to evaluate and report on the progress of these programmes. To do this, baseline data on the distribution of selected IAS are needed, which is one of the reasons we are publishing these data.

## Methodology

### Study extent description

This dataset is compiled from various data sources (research projects, monitoring programmes, unpublished dataset) available at the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO). Because many of these studies/projects are small, we chose to extract Chinese mitten crab occurrences from the original (mostly formerly unpublished) datasets and compile them into this dataset.

### Sampling description

Most of the Chinese mitten crabs were caught using double fyke nets in rivers and surface waters. These nets sample the lower 50 cm of the water column. The nets are placed parallel to the river's bank, as opposed to normal fyke nets that are placed at a 90° angle to the bank. Mitten crabs were mostly recorded as bycatch of fish monitoring or riverine/estuarine research projects. In most cases, the number of crabs per fyke was recorded, but for high density locations, the density was recorded as the net weight of crabs caught. Counts and weights are not included in this dataset and are available upon request.

### Quality control description

Fieldwork was mostly performed by professionals (trained experts or researchers) of the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO). However, 1797 records represent volunteer data from a validated citizen science project on the occurrence of fish in the Scheldt estuary. In this case, captures were performed by trained volunteers and data were subject to validation by the researcher involved.

## Project

### Project title

Implementation of the EU Regulation 1143/2014 on Invasive Alien Species

### Identifier

http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1417443504720&uri=CELEX:32014R1143

### Description

The EU regulation on the prevention and management of the introduction and spread of invasive alien species (IAS) requires member states to set up surveillance and early warning and rapidly eradicate new introductions of a selection of invasive alien species. Also, it requires member states to set up management programmes for widely established species and to evaluate and report on the progress of these programmes. To do this, baseline data on the distribution of selected IAS are needed. The project aims to identify IAS datasets, and to centralise and disclose them to the scientific and policy community.
