## Abstract

The Research Institute for Nature and Forest has a long tradition in the monitoring of non-native species in Flanders (northern Belgium). Although the species is long established in the Flemish region, observational data collected in this dataset date back to early 2000. Data originates from several research projects and monitoring initiatives running at the institute. At current (September 2015) the dataset contains 6000+ occurrence records of mitten crabs. Due to the different origin of the records not all the fields in the dataset could be completed. This dataset anticipates the future data demands of the EU regulation No 1143/2014 on the prevention and management of the introduction and spread of invasive alien species. Native to the Pacific coasts of China and Korea, mitten crabs arrived in European waters in the early 1900s. In Belgium, the species was first recorded in 1933 (Wouters 2002, Boets 2013). Chinese mitten crabs are believed to have been introduced via ship's ballast water and, possibly, intentionally released to establish fisheries (Marquard 1926; Peters et al. 1933; Gollasch 2006). Since its arrival in Germany, the Chinese mitten crab has rapidly invaded coastal and inland waters throughout Europe. The species was first observed in Belgium in 1933 in the Zeeschelde near Antwerp and is found nowadays in the main rivers and canals of the Scheldt basin. Since 2012 Chinese mitten crabs are also found in the canals near the Belgian coastline. The seasonal upstream migration of mitten crabs has become a well known phenomenon in Flanders (e.g. www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSBqwufl3pA). Despite this, the impact of mitten crabs is poorly studied in the region.

## Rationale

The EU regulation on the prevention and management of the introduction and spread of invasive alien species (IAS) requires member states to set up surveillance and early warning and rapidly eradicate new introductions of a selection of invasive alien species. Also, it requires member states to set up management programmes for widely established species and to evaluate and report on the progress of these programmes. To do this, baseline data on the distribution of selected IAS are needed. The project aims to identify IAS datasets, and to centralise and disclose them to the scientific and policy community.

## Methodology

### Study extent description

The Chinese mitten crab occurrences represent a dataset compiled dataset from various data sources (research projects, monitoring programmes, unpublished dataset) available at the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO). Because many of these studies/projects are small, we chose to extract mitten crab occurrences from the original (mostly formerly unpublished) datasets and compile them in this dataset.

### Sampling description

Most of the chinese mitten crabs were caught using double fyke nets in rivers and surface waters. These nets only sample the lower 50 cm of the water column. The capture devices are placed parallel to the river's bank, as opposed to normal fyke nets that are placed at a 90° angle to the bank. In these projects, mitten crab was mostly recorded as bycatch of fish monitoring or riverine/estuarine research projects. Mostly, the number of crabs per fyke was recorded, yet sometimes in case of high density locations, recorded density was expressed as the net weight of crabs caught. However, in this dataset, occurrences only comprise the geographic location of crabs caught. In case density data are needed, we advise to get in touch through the administrative contact.

### Quality control description

Fieldwork was mostly performed by professionals (trained experts or scientists) of the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO). However, 1797 records represent volunteer data from a validated citizen science project on the occurrence of fish in the Scheldt estuary. In this case, captures were performed by trained volunteers and data were subject to validation by the researcher involved.
